Master Animations for Games for GODOT

This repository is to store the files and notes from this course I am taking.  
It is NOT my course; if you want to take the course you should look at Zenva.
(The author of this course is Marco Paoletta)


I deviate from the course! 

Specifically, my preference is to code using C# (the course is in GDScript).

Notes:

The course is pretty simple, but you should be comfortable with GODOT.

Some elements that are covered include:

- AnimationPlayer - property, method calling, etc
- Event Handling - keypress detection in code
- Animation playing in code
- Particles

If you intend to use C# you will need some experience with GODOT and its C# API.

The course ends with simple jump and get a coin "mini-project" game. No sound or scrolling; its purpose is to demonstrate AnimationPlayer.

I did the course in *Godot_v4.5-dev2_mono_win64.exe* , I didn't encounter any issues. I think the course is targetted at 4.2.
